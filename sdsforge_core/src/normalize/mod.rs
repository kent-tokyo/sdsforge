//! Chemical structure normalization — a peer to [`crate::enrichment`], not
//! nested inside it or inside [`crate::generation`]. Mirrors the boundary
//! `docs/sdsforge-architecture.md`'s "chematic integration boundary" section
//! describes:
//!
//! ```text
//! enrichment  — resolves CAS -> candidate record(s) (PubChem)
//! normalize   — parses/canonicalizes/flags-inconsistency on a candidate
//!               enrichment already resolved (this module)
//! generation  — decides whether the result is usable, records provenance
//!               and uncertainty, maps verified data into the SDS draft
//! ```
//!
//! A normalizer never resolves CAS numbers, never predicts finished-product
//! properties (flash point, vapor pressure, GHS classification, ...), and
//! never becomes evidence for anything [`crate::generation`]'s
//! `PRODUCT_LEVEL_POLICIES` already governs — those stay exactly as commits
//! 2ac2758/d4dd15d ("A") left them, untouched by this module.
